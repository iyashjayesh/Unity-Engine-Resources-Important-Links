# Unity-Engine-Resources-Important-Links

## I have been invited by GirlScript Foundation to teach students online through a webinar on Game Development with "Unity Engine" for 7 days. This webinar covers from scratch to Intermediate level. It also consists of teaching them some advanced topics like Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Which we all know the future of technology. “We need to embrace technology to make learning more engaging. Because when students are engaged and they are interested, that's where learning takes place.” Topics covered in the webinar. So I prepared this document for them. 

## I hope this help you out.

## Thank You.
